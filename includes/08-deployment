<h1 id='deploying'>Deploying</h1>
<p>One of the goals of Booster is to become provider agnostic so you can deploy your application to any serverless provider like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc...</p>

<p>So far, in the current version, only AWS is supported, but given the high level of abstraction, it will eventually support
all cloud providers. (<strong>Contributions are welcome!</strong> ðŸ˜œ)</p>
<h2 id='configure-your-provider-credentials'>Configure your provider credentials</h2>
<p>In the case of AWS, it is required that your <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> are properly setup, and a <code>region</code> attribute is specified. If you have the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">AWS CLI installed</a>, you can create the config file by running the command <code>aws configure</code>, but that is completely optional, <strong>AWS CLI is not required to run booster</strong>. Creating a plain text file manually named <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> with the following content will be enough:</p>

<p><code>shell script
[default]
aws_access_key_id = &lt;YOUR KEY ID&gt;
aws_secret_access_key = &lt;YOUR ACCESS KEY&gt;
region = eu-west-1
</code></p>

<p>It&#39;s recomended to use IAM user keys and avoiding your root access keys. If you need help obtaining a <code>KEY ID</code> and <code>ACCESS KEY</code>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey">check out the oficial AWS guides</a>.</p>
<h2 id='deploy-your-project'>Deploy your project</h2>
<p>To deploy your Booster project, run the following command:</p>

<p><code>shell script
boost deploy
</code></p>

<p>It will take a while, but you should have your project deployed to your cloud provider.</p>

<p>If you make changes to your code, you can run <code>boost deploy</code> again to update your project in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id='deleting-your-cloud-stack'>Deleting your cloud stack</h2>
<p>If you want to delete the Booster application that has been deployed to the cloud, you can run:</p>

<p><code>shell script
boost nuke
</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This will delete everything in your stack, including databases. This action is <strong>not</strong> reversible!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After deploying your application, check out <a href="09-rest-api.md">the API documentation to start using it</a>!</p>
